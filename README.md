# Chess

## Day 1 (12/8/17)
I have finished the blank screen and main() function of the program.
Additionally, I have found code off of a post on Stack Overflow (https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/101574/chess-game-in-python) that I will be basing a majority of my future code around.
Tomorrow I will try my hand at developing my own take on the chess board object that the OP has in his program.
Future challenges I see for myself is that I believe the OP is not using Pygame, rather just raw text  as his pieces and board.
To deal with this, I will need to read up on the pygame API and incorporate a lot of pygame elements into OP's version of chess to be able to design it as I see it.
